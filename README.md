# Amazfish

Companion application for the Huami Amazfit Bip, Cor, MiBand2/3 and GTS

Requires sailfish version 3.0.3.8 or above due to changes in the base sailfish image

# Powered by KEXI

As of version 0.5.1, actiivity data is retrieved into an sqlite database.  Becuase I think it is important to allow individuals to be in control of their own data, and that they should have the ability to analyse it themsleves, I have chosen to store data in a KEXI compatible database.  This will allow you to copy the database from the phone, and open it up inside KEXI on Linux/Windows/Mac and perform queries and reports on it.  This added ability means i link to a couple of KDE libraries, which should be installed automatically.

# Firmware Download - READ FIRST - I am not liable if you brick your watch ;)

Read this for info about which files to flash https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/wiki/Amazfit-Bip

File download has been tested using an Amazfit Bip and GTS.

The firmware is split into multiple files on these devices.  With the official MiFit app, all are downloaded automatically in the correct oder.  With this app, you have to send each file individually.  The firmwares are available by extracting the MiFit apk, and looking in the assets/ folder for files named Mili_chaohu.* for the Bip.  GTS firmware files can be found online, the device name is kestrelw, but be sure the files your arw downloadling are legitimate.  When you select a file, its type and version will be determined, and you will be prevented from sending invalid files.

The firmware (.fw) requires a matching font (.ft) and resource (.res).  Send the firmware first, the app will send a reboot command at the end of the transfer, and the watch will boot up into a mode where it needs the matching font and resource sent.  Just wait for the app to connect again, then send the font and resource. 

The following types of file exist:

firmware, resource, a-gps data, fonts

So, to re-iterate, the firmware flashing order is:

    .fw
    .ft
    .res

# Amazfit GTS

GTS requires a server-side pairing key which requires inital pairing with an android device.  To get the key, follow the instructions here and enter into Amzafish when prompted, WITHOUT 0x at the beginning.

See https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/wiki/Amazfit-GTS

*MiBand 2/3/Cor*

These devices are untested and use the Bip backend.  Should be safe to try and FW download should not be allowed.

*Pairing Issues*

Pairing works for myself, sometimes I have to try twice.  If pairing doesnt work at all, then try:

    keep the app open, and pair again in the BT settings page of sailfish
    in the sailfish BT settings page, delete all entries and try again
    turn off/on BT on the phone
    factory reset the watch

Check if after all this, pairing works from the sailfish BT settings page.  It should pair and connect just fine from there.  f that doesnt work, my app wont either.

Not all features currently implemented

***May not work on all devices***

Uses Bluetooth Low Energy to communicate with the watch, this is known to be problematic on some devices.  it is known to work on the Xiaomi Mido.  Probably also works on the FP2 and is tested ont he XA2.

Implemented

    Pairing
    Notifications
    Calls
    Some settings
    Retrieving activities
    Heartrate Chart
    Alarms
    Watchface download
    Firmware upload
    Activity Sync
    Basic music control

Todo

    More Settings
    Support other devices (maybe eg MiBand2, as it is similar)

The Cor is also claimed to be working, but as i dont have that device, i cant test it.

Tip:
On your device, create a symlink in /home/nemo to /home/nemo/.local/share/harbour-amazfish
This way, you can easilty copy the database off the phone using MTP.
